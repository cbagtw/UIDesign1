        <h2>Visited Seochon Area to see young artists</h2>

            Today, I visited Seocheon Area to see the latest exhibition of gallery 'Space willing&Dealing'. The exhibition featured various works from local artists, including paintings, sculptures, and mixed media work. Each piece had a unique story and style, provoking thought and evoking emotions.

            One of my favorite pieces was a 3d sculpture work that used more features of a 2d painting, also vibrant colors and bold strokes to convey a sense of movement and energy. The form was really interesting and funny, allowing a lot of imagination to get into the work.
